Gameplay screen:
	- The restart button on the gameplay screen (maybe a fancy animation)
	- Better bomb discovery
	- Board absolute positioning

	- Frame skipping (loading animation)

General:
	- Weird saving when marshalling (?)

Optional:
	- Do a release for macos and windows
	- Catpuccin theme for the game
	- Gamepad support along with tab navigation
	- Maps don't allow for direct attribute assignment (!)
